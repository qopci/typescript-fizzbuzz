# TypeScript Program - FizzBuzz

My `TypeScript` program allows to iterate through 1-100 and provide an input for each number. 

If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, the code returns `fizzbuzz`
If the number is divisible by 3 only, the code returns `fizz`
If the number is divisible by 5 only, the code returns `buzz`
Otherwise, the code returns the `number` itself
